For My Final Year Project I have created a Date Control System for Supermarkets and companies who implement inventory databases to supermarkets for stock control and profit and loss records along with cashier till services such as CBE. - https://www.cbe.ie/

- This Application was built with the Ionic Framework along with Firebase as a Cloud Storage Database to store Data. 

The purpose of this application is to solve an exiting issue in retail globally, that being, Date Checking Suffiencey. Supermarket date checking as we know it is done manually and physically with the human eye. This makes it very limited and almost impossible to catch and see every product close or past their sell by date as the human eye does not see all. This application intercepts this inaccurate method of date checking. A staff member can use this application to pin point exactly what products are close or past their best before dates by simply going into a specific food group on the application and seeing the list of products for that section showing what is exactly close or past their sell by date. This saves the staff member time in their already busy schedule, not to mention saving the shop money in terms of being able to take action early to prevent money loss and risk of customer consumption of an out of date food item which can prove to be very dangerous.
